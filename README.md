# 🐾 ChaKla

**ChaKla** takes its name from the Thai legend of the *Cha kla* (ผีจะกละ):  
a nocturnal, black‑furred feline spirit with glowing eyes—mysterious, elusive, protective.  
It reflects the project’s purpose: watching over animals in the shadows, not people.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Monitor stray or rescued animals ethically
